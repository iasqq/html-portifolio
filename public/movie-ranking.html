<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>it's my type of crazy-emotional-funny story</p>

<h3>Interestelar</h3>
<p>my favorite intelligent-non-intelligent movie</p>

<h3>Ghost In The Shell</h3>
<p>
ok, this is definitely my favorite movie,<br/>
i love cyberpunk and mental reflections and i could easily pass an entire night just talk about it.
